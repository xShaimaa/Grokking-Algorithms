# **Grokking Algorithm Solutions**
This repo contains solutions for [Grokking Algorithms](https://eg1lib.org/book/2779892/2466e4) book by Aditya Bhargava.
Grokking Algorithms is a fully illustrated, friendly guide that teaches you how to apply common algorithms to the practical problems you face every day as a programmer. 
Starting from sorting and searching to help you build up your skills in thinking algorithmically. Each algotithm has some carefully presented examples that include helpful diagrams and fully annotated code samples in Python.
